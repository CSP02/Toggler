# ClassChanger
A package to toggle classes in vanilla js (not j-query)

# How to use:
- You can clone the project or just download the ToggleClass.js. (Will release a npm package later)
- include this script before including your main script.
for example:
```<script src = "ToggleClass.js"></script>```
```<scipt src = "myscript.js"></script>```
- After this you can use toggleClass(elementId, fromClass, toClass) method to toggle between classes in your main script.

# Syntax:
> toggleClass('elementID', 'fromClass', 'toClass')

Remember to use this syntax in your main script not in ToggleClass.js
<b> Note: Don't try to manipulate the ToggleClass.js unless you know javascript.<b>
