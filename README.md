# ClassChanger
A package(atleast the code) to toggle classes in vanilla js.

> I mostly use toggle classes while making a switch theme method, button interaction etc.
# New feature:

**Toggle images too:**
    - Now toggle images with ease.
    **Syntax**
    ```javascript 
    toggleImage('elementID', 'fromImage', 'toImage')
    ```

# How to use:
- You can clone the project or just download the ToggleClass.js. (Will release a npm package later)
- include this script before including your main script.
for example:
```html
<script src = "ToggleClass.js"></script>
<scipt src = "myscript.js"></script>
```
- After this you can use toggleClass(elementId, fromClass, toClass) method to toggle between classes in your main script.

# Syntax:
> toggleClass('elementID', 'fromClass', 'toClass')

<b> elementID: </b>

ID of the element to which you want to change the class.

<b> fromClass: </b>

element's current class name.

<b> toClass: </b>

New class name to the given element.

<b> Note: Remember all the arguments are strings.</b>

Remember to use this syntax in your main script not in ToggleClass.js

<b> Note: Don't try to manipulate the ToggleClass.js unless you know javascript.<b>
